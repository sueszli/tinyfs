Idea:

Write the most simple HTTP file server that serves static files from ./files that you can imagine.

Use as few object oriented features as possible, try to immitate golang. Keep it simple.

Run the code with: `make run`

Test it with: `curl -i 0.0.0.0:8888`



---

An HTTP file server that serves static files from a configurable directory on the hosting computer.

System requirements:

- Handle concurrent requests appropriately
- Serve files with correct MIME types and HTTP headers
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Implement error handling with exceptions or error codes
- Nice to have: Also support directories
- Support graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Write high quality code, use RAII and smart pointers where necessary
- Write tests, handle errors
- Nice to have: Configurable storage directory via command line argument (default: "./files")

Test:

`curl -i 0.0.0.0:8888/yippie.txt`
